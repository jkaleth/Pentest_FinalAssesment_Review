<p><strong>Aircrack-ng</strong> - <strong>decipher encryption keys</strong> - is the tool within the Aircrack-ng suite that would be used to attempt to decipher the encryption key of the APs. Aircrack-ng performs key cracking based on collected data, making it a suitable choice for this scenario.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's suite of utilities is made up of several command-line tools used for wireless monitoring, attacking, testing and password cracking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Airmon-ng</strong> - <strong>Monitor Mode</strong> -is used to switch wireless network cards into monitor mode, which is a prerequisite for capturing data packets on your network but does not crack encryption keys itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Airodump-ng</strong> - DUMP FRAMES <strong>captuers packets</strong> - <strong>captures Frames</strong> --is used to capture packets from a wireless router. While it's important for the process because it gathers the data that Aircrack-ng will analyze, it doesn't decipher encryption keys on its own.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a tool that provides the ability to capture 802.11 frames and then use the output to identify the Basic Service Set ID (MAC address) of an access point</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aireplay-ng</strong> - <strong>inject frames</strong> - is used to inject frames into wireless networks to generate traffic for later analysis. It is instrumental in certain types of attacks, but the actual cracking of encryption keys is not its function.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Metasploit Framework</strong> is a free open-source command-line version of a popular PenTest tool. By default, it is installed with a fresh install of the popular Kali Linux image.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Armitage</strong> is an intuitive <strong>third-party GUI for the Metasploit framework.</strong> This add-on provides the ability to avoid using the utility with command-line commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cobalt Strike is a third-party commercial version of Armitage.</strong> Unlike Armitage, it includes many advanced features and detailed reporting is included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metasploit Pro</strong> is a full-featured graphical version that includes Quick Start wizards, easy vulnerability scanning and validation, phishing campaigns, and reporting. **</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gobuster</strong> can discover subdomains, directories, and files by brute-forcing from a list of common names. This can provide information that was otherwise not available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wapiti</strong> is a web application vulnerability scanner that will automatically navigate a web app looking for areas where it can inject data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TruffleHog</strong> is a Git secrets search tool. It can automatically crawl through a repository looking for accidental commits of <strong>secrets</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>BeEF (Browser Exploit Framework)</strong> focuses on <strong>web browser attacks</strong> by assessing the actual security posture of a target by using client-side attack vectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mimikatz</strong> - can be used to gather credentials by extracting key elements from memory such as cleartext passwords, hashes, and PIN codes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medusa</strong> - is a parallel brute-forcer for network logins. Its focus is to support numerous network services that allow remote authentication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brutespray</strong> allows for the interpretation of results from an Nmap scan to automatically start medusa against the identified open ports. It can also use results from nmap with option &quot;-sV&quot; to identify and target services on non-standard ports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hydra</strong> - tool is brute force tool similar to medusa, in that it supports parallel testing of several network authentications. It comes bundled with a tool called pw-inspect.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="nmap-basics">NMAP Basics</h3>
<p>A defaul NMAP Scan Does This:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</strong> requests are sent to hosts to obtain Media Access Control (MAC) address details. The MAC address can be used for purposes such as access control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ICMP type 13</strong> By default, a Nmap scan will use the timestamp, which is provided message for ICMP type 13, of 32 bits of milliseconds since midnight UT during host discovery.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nmap-commands">NMAP Commands</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>-O </code> - OS Detection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-sV </code> - <strong>Banner Grabbigng</strong> - Version Detection. It performs version detection on the open ports that are found. In its simple form, this process is generally known as banner grabbing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-sY</code> An SCTP Initiation Ping uses the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), an alternative to using either a TCP or UDP scan to see if a host is alive. This scan requires using the -sY option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-sV --script vulners</code> scan automation to find vulnerabilities using built in scripts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>nmap ipaddress</code> By default, Nmap will perform a TCP scan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>TCP SYN (synchronize)</code> Default action- packet starts a communication session with a host by using TCP to initiate a conversation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-PU</code> A UDP protocol scan can be initiated by using the -PU for port scanning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-sS</code> Stealth Scan</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A stealth scan uses techniques that try to exploit the expected behavior of TCP. When used alone, the scans may have limited effectiveness. Using other scans in conjunction can fill in the gaps of information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A stealth scan in noncredentialed that uses fewer permissions, and many times can only find missing patches or updates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="nmap-responses">NMAP Responses</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Open</strong> - Nmap reports that a port is open by making a valid connection to the system and to the port itself. When open, the system responds to any probes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Closed</strong> - When a port is closed, probes reach the system but the port itself is not reachable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Filtered</strong> filtered port is reported by Nmap when it is concluded that the port is being blocked by a firewall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unfiltered</strong> - An unfiltered port is reported when the system and the port are accessible, however, Nmap is unable to determine if the port is open or closed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="timing-commands">Timing Commands</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>T0/T1</strong> - Slow scans, IDS evasion, rate limiting.</p>
<ul>
<li>T0 = paranoid scan</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>T2</strong> - last to use serial scanning. faster than T0 and T1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>T3</strong> - Default timing setting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>T4</strong> - Fast scan, relatively stable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>T5</strong> - Fasted option but unstable. Should only beused on network that can handle the speed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="trafic-visibility">Trafic Visibility</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Port monitoring</strong> - To capture all traffic on a switch port, port monitoring can be used. This typically required logging into the switch and enabling monitoring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Switched port analysis (SPAN)</strong> - To capture all traffic on a switch, an option is to use switched port analysis (SPAN). With SPAN, all ingress and egress traffic is copied between ports. This is also referred to as mirroring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Promiscuous mode</strong> - is required when trying to monitor all traffic on a network. Without this mode enabled, sniffing will not pick up all network traffic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ports">Ports</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMB</strong> - <code>139 or 445</code></li>
<li><strong>LDAP</strong> - <code>389</code> Active Directory</li>
<li><strong>RPC</strong> - <code>111</code></li>
<li><strong>NETBIOS</strong> - <code>445</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="packet-crafting">Packet Crafting</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Decoding</strong> - the capture of the packets sent will help to determine how the test went. The Pentester can analyze traffic generated using a packet analyzer such as Wireshark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Editing</strong> a packet is similar to assembling a packet. The difference is that the packet content is modified after it was created or captured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assembling</strong> - a packet involves the creation of the packet to be sent. This may involve setting malformed information to see how the traffic is handled by certain devices on a network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Playing</strong> in the packet crafting process is the actual release of the packet into the wild. The packet is sent or resent (if edited) on the network.</p>
</li>

<hr>
<h3 id="engagement-related">Engagement Related</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Master Service Agreement</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Insurance</strong> - Conducting a PenTest for an organization is a business arrangement, and all terms of the test should be clearly defined. Any general and liability insurance should be outlined if something goes wrong and damages occur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Safety guidelines and environmental concerns</strong> - should be part of a master service agreement. Such guidelines should outline prohibited areas and the use of the facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Project scope</strong> - is defined within the master service agreement. The project scope is a definition of the specific work that is to be performed and completed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reconnaissance</strong> focuses on gathering as much information about the target as possible. This process includes searching information on the Internet, using Open-Source Information Gathering Tools (OSINT).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scanning</strong> is a critical phase as it provides more information about available network resources. Scanning identifies live hosts, listening ports, and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong> - <strong>New Vulns</strong> - It is possible that the team found new unknown vulnerabilities during the testing. Additional personnel training or updated tools may be part of a lessons learned report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Client follow-up</strong> - is not part of a lessons learned report but rather a revisit to a client after testing and mitigation techniques have been implemented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mitigation implementation</strong> - Although a Pentest team may assist, a mitigation implementation is the responsibility of the client and is not part of a lesson learned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Client Acceptance</strong> - During the formal hand-off process, confirmation from the client that they agree that the testing is complete and that they accept your findings as presented is important. This is not part of a lessons learned report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong> occurs after a team has completed an exercise. A collection of the results of all activities are analyzed, and a summary is derived of the risk ratings for each.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reporting</strong> - will deliver the results and any remediation suggestions to the stakeholders, along with a realistic timeline of reducing risk and implementing corrective actions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="in-scope">In Scope</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Users</strong> are an in-scope asset, as they are susceptible to social engineering, and are generally considered to be the easiest attack vector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Domains and/or subdomains</strong> within the organization are a prime target for malicious activity and are an in-scope asset. Domains and subdomains are examples such as example.com and ftp.example.com.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service Set Identifiers (SSID)</strong> can be targeted when an attacker is attempting to access a wireless network. As such, they are an in-scope asset.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>SingleApostrophe</strong> - <em><strong><code>'</code></strong></em> The most common method for identifying possible SQL injection vulnerabilities in a web app is to submit a single apostrophe and then look for errors. This is called the single quote method. If an error is returned, it may provide SQL syntax details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certain web app APIs also allow the stacking of multiple queries within the same call. This can be useful for injecting new query types into a form's existing query type.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>1.<strong>Discover phase</strong> - is the first step in finding a potential vulnerability that can be exploited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coordinate phase</strong> - occurs after discovering a vulnerability. During this phase, the vulnerability is defined, listed, and published.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manage phase</strong> - is where the patch has been released. As such, the next step is to apply the patch in order to remediate or mitigate the vulnerability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Document phase</strong> - is the final phase. In this phase, the vulnerability patch has been tested, and all involved will take a moment to document what has been done. In addition, it's best to reflect on lessons learned, in order to prevent further exposure.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Salt</strong> - <strong>added before hashing</strong> A randomly generated string, known as a salt, can be added to a password before hashing. This salt can be stored along with the hashed password for verification purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hashing</strong> - is a method that is used to encrypt passwords. A hashing algorithm takes a given value (password) and converts it into another value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Password encryption</strong> - uses one of a number of algorithms for protection. Otherwise, a password would be visible as clear text when transmitted across a network.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dns">DNS</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Recursion</strong> - <strong>queries results from other servers</strong> -  <strong>not reliable or safe</strong> A DNS server that allows recursion and is incorrectly configured might be more exposed to unauthorized updates because it's designed to query and cache results from other servers. It could be tricked into caching and then serving unauthorized updates if it's not well-secured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Poisoned cache</strong> - <strong>response to queries</strong> - is a security concern, it is not directly related to the server's response to dynamic updates. Poisoning affects the server's response to queries, not its policy on accepting updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Invalid Records</strong> - If a DNS server contains invalid records, it suggests a problem has occurred, such as incorrect manual entries or a successful attack on the server (like cache poisoning).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authoritative</strong> - Being authoritative does not imply a lack of authentication for dynamic updates; it's a separate aspect of DNS server behavior. An authoritative server, just like any other, should be configured to authenticate dynamic updates properly to maintain security.</p>
