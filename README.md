# PenTest Plus - Final Assessment Review

- **Bluesnarfing** - **Ability to Read Data** -is an aggressive attack, as a malicious actor is able to read information from a victim's Bluetooth device. Bluesnarfing is ineffective against devices that set Bluetooth in non-discoverable mode.

- **Bluejacking** is a method used by attackers to send out unwanted text messages, images, or videos to a mobile phone, tablet, or laptop using a Bluetooth connection.

- **Postman** - is a tool that provides an interactive and automatic environment used to interact and test an API.

### Google Hacking
---
- **link:comptia.org about** - **Link Operator** - <ins>To find a link to a specified page</ins>, the link operator is used. Searching link:comptia.org about will search for pages that link to CompTIA's website and have the text "about" on the page.

- **inanchor:about employees** When searching for anchor text, the inanchor operator is used. Searching inanchor:about employees <ins>will search for pages with the anchor text "about" and with the text "employees" on the page.</ins>

- **inurl:about employees** A URL can be searched for text with the inurl operator. Searching inurl:about employees <ins>will search for pages whose URLs include the text "about" and have the text "employees" on the page.</ins>

- **site:comptia.org about** - To search a site for text, the site operator is used. Searching site:comptia.org would be used to search CompTIA's website for the text "about."

### Tools
---
- **Metasploit Framework** is a free open-source command-line version of a popular PenTest tool. By default, it is installed with a fresh install of the popular Kali Linux image.

- **Armitage** is an intuitive **third-party GUI for the Metasploit framework.** This add-on provides the ability to avoid using the utility with command-line commands.

- **Cobalt Strike is a third-party commercial version of Armitage.** Unlike Armitage, it includes many advanced features and detailed reporting is included.

- **Metasploit Pro** is a full-featured graphical version that includes Quick Start wizards, easy vulnerability scanning and validation, phishing campaigns, and reporting. **

- **Gobuster** can discover subdomains, directories, and files by brute-forcing from a list of common names. This can provide information that was otherwise not available.

- **Wapiti** is a web application vulnerability scanner that will automatically navigate a web app looking for areas where it can inject data.

- **TruffleHog** is a Git secrets search tool. It can automatically crawl through a repository looking for accidental commits of **secrets**.

- **BeEF (Browser Exploit Framework)** focuses on **web browser attacks** by assessing the actual security posture of a target by using client-side attack vectors.

### NMAP Commands
---

- ```-sY``` An SCTP Initiation Ping uses the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), an alternative to using either a TCP or UDP scan to see if a host is alive. This scan requires using the -sY option.

- ```nmap ipaddress``` By default, Nmap will perform a TCP scan. 

- ```TCP SYN (synchronize)``` Default action- packet starts a communication session with a host by using TCP to initiate a conversation. 

- ```-PU``` A UDP protocol scan can be initiated by using the -PU for port scanning.

### Engagement Related

---

- **Analysis** occurs after a team has completed an exercise. A collection of the results of all activities are analyzed, and a summary is derived of the risk ratings for each.

- **Reporting** will deliver the results and any remediation suggestions to the stakeholders, along with a realistic timeline of reducing risk and implementing corrective actions.

- **Scanning** is a critical phase as it provides more information about available network resources. Scanning identifies live hosts, listening ports, and more.

- **Reconnaissance** focuses on gathering as much information about the target as possible. This process includes searching information on the Internet, using Open-Source Information Gathering Tools (OSINT).

#### In Scope

- **Users** are an in-scope asset, as they are susceptible to social engineering, and are generally considered to be the easiest attack vector.

- **Domains and/or subdomains** within the organization are a prime target for malicious activity and are an in-scope asset. Domains and subdomains are examples such as example.com and ftp.example.com.

- **Service Set Identifiers (SSID)** can be targeted when an attacker is attempting to access a wireless network. As such, they are an in-scope asset.

#### Typically not in scope

- **Password** Passwords are dynamic in nature and can be reset at any time. The systems that provide and require the passwords would be an in-scope asset.

#### Engagement Scope/Risk

- **Risk appetite**- refers to the amount and type of potential vulnerabilities and threats the organization is willing to tolerate and endure.

- **Metrics** are quantifiable measurements of the status of results or processes. An example of a metric related to PenTesting is the criticality of vulnerability findings.

- **Measures** - are the specific data points that contribute to a metric. Values may be a percentage of systems that are susceptible to a particular vulnerability.

- **Risk rating** - is the process of assigning quantitative values to the identified risks. This is usually done by following a reference framework.

### SQL Injection

---

- **SingleApostrophe** - ***```'```*** The most common method for identifying possible SQL injection vulnerabilities in a web app is to submit a single apostrophe and then look for errors. This is called the single quote method. If an error is returned, it may provide SQL syntax details.

- Certain web app APIs also allow the stacking of multiple queries within the same call. This can be useful for injecting new query types into a form's existing query type.

**Blind SQL injectio**n is injecting SQL when the web application's response does not contain the result of the query.

- Adding a time delay to a Blind SQL injection is known as time-based blind SQLi.

### PCI Compliance

---

**<ins>PCI DSS mandates a RoC</ins>**

- **Level 1** - merchants process over **6 million transactions annually**, which categorizes them as high-risk. The  for these merchants, requiring a formal assessment by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) due to the high volume of transactions.
 
- **Level 2** - merchants process 1 to 6 million transactions annually and typically complete a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), but an acquiring bank may require an audit and ROC.
 
**<ins>No RoC Required</ins>**

- **Level 3** - merchants process 20,000 to 1 million transactions annually. They are not required to complete a RoC and typically do not choose this option.
 
- **Level 4** - merchants process fewer than 20,000 e-commerce transactions annually. They are low-risk and do not complete a RoC for PCI DSS compliance.

### Netcat Commands

---

#### Create Pessistent Listener

- ```-L``` option starts Netcat in the Windows-only "listen harder" mode. This mode creates a persistent listener that starts listening again when the client disconnects.

- ```-p``` option specifies the port that Netcat should start listening on in listening mode. When used in client mode, this value specifies the source port.

- ```-e``` option specifies the program to execute when a connection is made. This is useful for alerts and logging.

#### Non-persistent

- ```-l``` option starts Netcat in listen mode. This is a non-persistent mode. The default mode without this option is to act as a client.
